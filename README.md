# MNIST Model Evaluation Project

This project involves the development of four different predictive models for the MNIST dataset and providing an interactive program for users to evaluate these models.

## Project Structure

- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and validation.
- `README.md`: Explanation of the project structure and decision-making process.

## Models Developed

1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest
3. Neural Network
4. Bayesian Logistic Regression

## Decision Making

### Data Preprocessing
- The MNIST dataset was normalized and split into training, validation, and test sets.
- Standardization was applied to ensure better model performance.

### Model Selection
- **Logistic Regression**: Chosen for its simplicity and interpretability.
- **Random Forest**: Selected for its ability to handle non-linear relationships.
- **Neural Network**: Implemented to capture complex patterns in the data.
- **Bayesian Logistic Regression**: Utilized to incorporate prior information and provide probabilistic predictions.

### Code Structure
- The code is organized into functions and scripts to maintain modularity and readability.
- Standard coding practices such as PEP 8 were followed.

## Running the Project

1. Open and run `notebook.ipynb` to see the data exploration, preprocessing, and model training steps.
2. Follow the interactive prompts to choose and evaluate models on random samples from the MNIST dataset.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates the application of data science techniques and best coding practices to develop and evaluate predictive models.
